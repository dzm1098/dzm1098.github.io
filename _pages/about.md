Hi, I'm **Ziming Dong**.

I am an M.Sc. student in Computer Science at the University of Victoria (expected Aug 2027), focusing on **large language models on edge devices**.

Previously, I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science at UVic (with Distinction), and have experience as a TA for CSC361 and as an RA on efficient LLM frameworks.

I also have experience as a photographer, working with the UVic Faculty of Humanities, the UVic International Student Centre, Broad View United, the Rainhouse Engineering Showcase, and the Victoria Cycling League.

Outside research and photography, I enjoy cycling and running.

This website contains my CV, selected research, photography work, and ongoing updates.
